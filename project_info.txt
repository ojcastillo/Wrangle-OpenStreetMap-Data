Description:
    (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracas)

    Caracas is the capital, the center of the Greater Caracas Area, and the largest city of Venezuela.
    Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, following the contours
    of the narrow Caracas Valley on the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa).

    The Metropolitan District of Caracas is made up of five municipalities: Libertador Municipality which is
    the only administrative division of the Venezuelan Capital District, and four other municipalities, which
    are within in Miranda State: Chacao, Baruta, Sucre, and El Hatillo. Libertador holds many of the government
    buildings and is the Capital District (Distrito Capital). The Distrito Capital had a population of 2,013,366
    as of 2011, while the Metropolitan District of Caracas was estimated at 3,273,863 as of (2013).
    The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of 5,243,301.

Reason for choice:

    I was born and raised in Venezuela, so when I was given the chance to select a region of the world, I naturally
    gravitated towards it. Caracas was the only city in Venezuela for which I could find a map extract, which is why
    I selected it. Additionally, I really wanted to a explore a non-english dataset to understand the challenges that
    other encodings might bring, and since Spanish is the main language in Venezuela, that reinforced my decision.
